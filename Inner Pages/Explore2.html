						<h2><center>RED FORT</center></h2>
						<p><center>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, the Red Fort in the Indian capital, is the apex of Mughal architecture, and hence, one of a kind structures in the country. It is one of the most well preserved, thus famous forts in India. Made completely out of red sandstone, the fort has been maintained in an excellent condition, and that is why the fort still has not lost its scarlet tinge. This fort in India also went on to become a huge symbol of perfected architecture to various structures designed in the neighbouring states. .
							The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan, and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.

						<h3><center>History</center></h3>
						<p>Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, Shah Jahan's favourite colours, its design is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal.The fort lies along the Yamuna River, which fed the moats surrounding most of the walls. Construction began in the sacred Islamic month of Muharram, on 13 May 1638.  Supervised by Shah Jahan, it was completed on 6 April 1648.Unlike other Mughal forts, the Red Fort's boundary walls are asymmetrical to contain the older Salimgarh Fort.The fortress-palace was a focal point of the city of Shahjahanabad, which is present-day Old Delhi. Shah Jahan's successor, Aurangzeb, added the Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque) to the emperor's private quarters, constructing barbicans in front of the two main gates to make the entrance to the palace more circuitous.</p>
