						<h2><center>SINDHUDURG</center></h2>
						<p><center>Sindhudurg Fort is located in the Malvan town of Sindhudurg District (Konkan region) of Maharashtra, 500 km south of Mumbai. It was constructed by Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj and is a fort in India of daunting size. Iron was used for casting after the foundation was laid. Presently, most tourists visit the fort because of the well-established scuba-diving and snorkelling attractions nearby.
							Sindhudurg Fort is a historical fort that occupies an island in the Arabian Sea, just off the coast of Maharashtra in Western India. The fort was built by Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. The fortress lies on the shore of Malvan town of Sindhudurg District in the Konkan region of Maharashtra, 450 kilometres (280 mi) south of Mumbai. It is a protected monument.
							Shivaji Maharaj brought 200 Vaddera people for building this fort. Over 4,000 pounds of lead were used in the casting and foundation stones were firmly laid down. Construction started on 25 November 1664. Built over a period of three years (1664-1667), the sea fort is spread over 48 acres, with a two-mile (3 km) long rampart, and walls that are 30 feet (9.1 m) high and 12 feet (3.7 m) thick. The massive walls were designed to serve as a deterrent to approaching enemies and to the waves and tides of the Arabian Sea.
							 The main entrance is concealed in such a way that no one can pinpoint it from outside.</center>

						<h3><center>History</center></h3>
						<p>Sindhudurg island-fort was built by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, the 17th-century ruler of Maratha Empire.Its main objective was to counter the rising influence of foreign (English, Dutch, French and Portuguese) merchants and to curb the rise of Siddhis of Janjira. Construction was supervised by Hiroji Indulkar in 1664. The fort was built on a small island known as the Khurte island.
						At a time when traveling by sea was banned by scriptures, this construction on an island represents the revolutionary mindset of its engineer. A remain of an iron mould can be seen.
						The number of permanent residents living in the fort has been in decline since its abandonment. Most residents have moved out due to inadequate employment opportunities but some families remain. The fort is closed for tourists during rainy season due to high tides.</p>
