						<h2><center>CHITTORGARH FORT</center></h2>
						<p><center>
							Chittorgarh Fort is the biggest fort in India, and also a World Heritage Site. Spread over about 2.8 kms and 400 acres and the highest elevation in the fort is at about 1075 metres. The two distinct pillars in the fortress, the Kirti Stambh and the Vijay Stambh are extremely preciously carved with the most intricate artwork found in the region. Without about twenty water bodies, nineteen temples and four palace complexes and memorials, this is one historical site that needs quite some time for exploration and will leave a lasting impression on you for a while.
							The Chittorgarh Fort also known as Chittorgarh or Chittor Fort is one of the largest forts in India. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The fort was the capital of Mewar and is located in the present-day town of Chittorgarh. It sprawls over a hill 180 m (590.6 ft) in height spread over an area of 280 ha (691.9 acres) above the plains of the valley drained by the Berach River. The fort covers 65 historic structures, which include four palaces, 19 large temples, 20 large water bodies, 4 memorials and a few victory towers.</center>

						<h3><center>History</center></h3>
						<p>Chittorgarh (garh means fort) was originally called Chitrakut. It is said to have been built by a local Mori Rajput ruler Chitrangada Mori. According to one legend, the name of the fort is derived from its builder. Another folk legend attributes the construction of fort to the legendary hero Bhima: it states that Bhima struck the ground here, which resulted in water springing up to form a large reservoir. The water body allegedly formed by Bhima is an artificial tank called Bhimlat Kund. Several small Buddhist stupas dated to 9th century based on the script were found at the edge of Jaimal Patta lake.
						The Guhila ruler Bappa Rawal is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE. One account states that he received the fort in dowry. According to other versions of the legend, Bappa Rawal captured the fort either from the mlechchhas or the Moris.
						Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that the Moris (Mauryas) were ruling at Chittor when the Arabs (mlechchhas) invaded north-western India around 725 CE.</p>
