						<h2><center>DAULATABAD FORT</center></h2>
						<p><center>Daulatabad Fort was the capital fort of the Tughlaqs, under Muhammad bin Tughlaq. This hotly debated and argued upon fort in India, built upon a whim, remains a sight to witness. Muhammad bin Tughlaq forcibly moved the whole population of Delhi to here, and before he knew it, they ran out of the water and eventually had to abandon the Fort and city.
							Deogiri Fort, also known as Devagiri or Deogiri, is a historic fortified citadel located in Devagiri village near Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India. It was the capital of the Yadava dynasty (9th century–14th century CE), for a brief time the capital of the Delhi Sultanate (1327–1334), and later a secondary capital of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate.
							Around the 6th century CE, Devagiri emerged as an important uplands town near present-day Aurangabad, along caravan routes going towards western and southern India. The historical triangular fortress in the city was initially built around 1187 by the first Yadava king, Bhillama V.[10] In 1308, the city was annexed by Sultan Alauddin Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate, which ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent. In 1327, Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq of the Delhi Sultanate renamed the city Daulatabad and shifted his imperial capital to the city from Delhi, ordering a mass migration of Delhi's population to Daulatabad. However, Muhammad bin Tughluq reversed his decision in 1334 and the capital of the Delhi Sultanate was shifted back to Delhi.

						<h3><center>History</center></h3>
						<p>The site had been occupied since at least 100 BCE, and now has remains of Hindu & Jain temples similar to those at Ajanta and Ellora. A series of niches carved with Jain Tirthankara in cave 32.
						The city is said to have been founded c. 1187 by Bhillama V, a Yadava prince who renounced his allegiance to the Chalukyas and established the power of the Yadava dynasty in the west. During the rule of the Yadava king Ramachandra, Alauddin Khalji of Delhi Sultanate raided Devagiri in 1296, forcing the Yadavas to pay a hefty tribute. When the tribute payments stopped, Alauddin sent a second expedition to Devagiri in 1308, forcing Ramachandra to become his vassal.</p>
